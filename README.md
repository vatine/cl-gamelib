This is more for historical interest, but I thought I would rescue it from the depths of history and display my youthful foolishness more widely.

This is the abstracted code from Gatlopp and Pantzer, two games I wrote in Common Lisp, using CLX (essentially Xlib for Common Lisp). Gatlopp was a top-down-view 2D game, Panzter was a 3D first-tank-view shooter ,with the 3D engine completely written by me (nd, unconventionally, uses a right-hand coordinate system, because that's what I was used to, not really having done any 3D programming with any other framework).
