<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Gamelib is a project to create a library suitable for writing games in
Common Lisp. The general idea is to start slow and eventually let
ambition grow as far as can be.</p>

<p>The initial graphical platform for Gamelib is <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/CLX">CLX</a>, with no sound. In time, this
might expand to using OpenGL (where available, posisbly via
third-party packages) or using DirectDraw (when, say, running under
Win32). There are nothing more than vague plans in those directiosn,
right now. Help is, as usual, appreciated.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Gamelib has four components, <a href="ai.html">the AI component</a>, the <a href="games-2d.html">games-2D</a> component, the
<a href="3d.html">games-3d</a> component and the <a href="stick.html">joystick</a> component.</p>

<h2>Intended use</h2>

Since a few parameters that one might want to change are defined as
constants, it is recommended that any distributed game that uses
gamelib and can't use the standard settings ships a customized version
of the required files from gamelib (in general, the AI component and
one of the two game display components).

<h3>License</h3>
<p>Gamelib is licensed under an MIT license (essentially, do what you
want, but make sure to keep attributions around).</p>
