  <h2>The joystick library</h2>
 </div>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Having the use of a joystick enhances the sensation of presence in a
game. Under linux, the available joystick API is based around periodic
reading of events from a device driver file (usually /dev/js<i>X</i>
or /dev/input/js<i>X</i>).</p>

<p>Gamelib now offers an interface to handle joysticks on the linux
platform (code for joystick handling on other platforms is
welcome). The joystick is somewhat abstracted from the raw data that
the device driver offers.</p>

<h3>API</h3>

<p>The interface is centred around a JOYSTICK object (created by calling
MAKE-STICK with a suitable device name as argument). To read an event
from the device driver, call UPDATE-STICK with the joystick object as
argument.</p>

<p>Under SBCL (with thread support) there is a "continous poll" support
(simply call CONTINOUS-POLL with the joystick object as argument, to
terminate the polling thread, call TERMINATE-POLL with the object as
argument). All relevant locking is done, keyed on if a joystick is
polled or not. Still, the publicly available information will only be
done after a call to UPDATE-STICK.</p>

<p>There are two arrays that are of interest in a joystick object
<i>js</i>. The first is the analog axes, (axes <i>js</i>) and the
second is the buttons (buttons <i>js</i>). The library currently
supports up to 8 analog axes and up to 24 buttons (and will most
likely crash in amusing ways, should these limits be too strict).</p>

<p>As part of the update and transformation from signed 16-bit integers
to SINGLE-FLOAT, some transformations of the data can be done. The
(currently) available library functions are SIMPLE-TRANSFER (the
default), a simple division by 32768.0s0 and SQUARE-TRANSFER (the
result of a SIMPLE-TRANSFER, squared and multiplied by the
signum).</p>

<p>A graph displaying these two transfer functions (X axis is raw
joystick data, Y axis is the displacement along the axis available
from GAMES-STICK):<br>

<h3>Full STICK package exported symbol list</h3>
<dl>
<dt> (axes <i>joystick</i>)
  <dd> Returns an array, with axis 0 at index 0, axis 1 at index 1 and
so on.
<dt> (buttons <i>joystick</i>)
  <dd> Returns a bit-vector, with button 0 at index 0, button 1 at
index 1 and so forth. A value of 0 means "not pressed", a value of 1
means "pressed".
<dt> (make-stick <i>device-file</i>)
  <dd> Create a joystick object for the named device.
<dt> (set-transfer <i>joystick</i> <i>axis</i> <i>transfer-fn</i>)
  <dd> Set the transfer function for axis to the desired transfer
function. A transfer function should map from [ -32768, 32767 ] to [
-1.0s0, 1.0s0 ].
<dt> (simple-transfer <i>value</i>)
  <dd> A simple transfer function (linear mapping from the integer
range to the single-float range).
<dt> (square-transfer <i>value</i>)
  <dd> A slightly more complex transfer function, causing less
sensitivity in the "close to centred" region and slightly higher
sensitivity in the more extreme regions.
<dt> (update-stick <i>joystick</i>)
  <dd> Copy current (hidden) data to teh publicly available data. Also
applies the relevant transfer functions.
<dt> (continous-poll <i>joystick</i>)
  <dd> Only available if build with :SB-THREAD available on
*FEATURES*.<br>Start a separate thread reading from the device. Still
requires UPDATE-STICK to copy from private to pubic data. 
<dt> (terminate-poll <i>joystick</i>)
  <dd> Only available if build with :SB-THREAD available on
*FEATURES*.<br>Terminate continous polling for a specific joystick.
