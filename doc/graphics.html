  <h2>The games-2d library</h2>
 </div>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is the package that exports all the things that cause things to be
shown on screen. It manages the display of background, moving objects,
update window and manages input. The graphics library is also
responsible of mapping from a tile keyword to a given image.</p>

<p>Within the graphics library, directions are referred to as "north", "east",
"south" and "west" (and combinations of these). Depending on exact circumstances, these directions will be numerically coded as the integers 0-7 or as keywords.</p>

<h3>Mapping tiles to images</h3>
<p>The mapping from tile to image is done with the <tt>MAP-FILE</tt> macro.
MAP-FILE takes a keyword designator and a file-name as arguments. The
file-name is then merged with <tt>*FILE-PATH*</tt> (defined in globals.lisp,
defaults to "<i>source-directory</i>/graphics/", change before calling
map-file). The <tt>MAP-FILE</tt> macro is evaluated at load time.</p>

<p>At the moment, the only supported bitmap format is XPM. People are
enthusiastically encouraged to write readers for other bitmap formats
(in CL, ideally). In the end, the file-reading function is dispatched
depending on mappings in <tt>*IMAGE-TYPES*</tt>, a hashtable using file type as
key and a file-reading function as value.</p>

<h3>Mapping movables to images</h3>
<p>The mapping from a movable object to a set of images is done with the
<tt>MAP-ANIMATIONS</tt> macro. This macro takes three arguments: the class name
of the movable to map, a list specifying base images for animatiosn
for up/down/left/right movement and a list specifying base images for
diagonal movement.</p>

<p>A <a name="animspec">base image specification</a> is a list like <tt>(<i>file-name</i> <i>frame#</i> ...)</tt>,
so listing image file and what frames in sequence they will be used
in. It is a limitation that diagonal animation sequence has to be as
long as non-diagonal (though it's a limitation that probably isn't too
bad).</p>

<p>The base images should be pointing "east" and "south east". These will
be rotated in 90&deg; increments, to form the images for the remaining
orientations. Two clip masks will be formed, one selecting only the
non-black and one selecting only the black parts of the image ("black"
means all of Red, Green and Blue are 0), to provide the illusion of
transparence of the moving image.</p>

<h3>Animation example</h3>
<p>As an example how animations can be built and declared in the game, I
will use the player animations from Gatlopp.</p>
<pre>
(map-animation player
	       (("player-purple-0.xpm" 0 4 8)
		("player-purple-1.xpm" 1 3)
		("player-purple-2.xpm" 2)
		("player-purple-3.xpm" 5 7)
		("player-purple-4.xpm" 6))
	       (("player-purple-diag-0.xpm" 0 4 8)
		("player-purple-diag-1.xpm" 1 3)
		("player-purple-diag-2.xpm" 2)
		("player-purple-diag-3.xpm" 5 7)
		("player-purple-diag-4.xpm" 6)))
</pre>
<p>This results in an 8-frame animation cycle, that looks as follows:<br>
<table>
<tr><td>Frame#</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Straights</td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-0.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-1.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-2.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-1.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-0.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-3.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-4.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-3.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>Straights</td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-0.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-1.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-2.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-1.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-0.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-3.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-4.png"></td>
 <td><img src="player-purple-diag-3.png"></td></tr>
</table>
</p>

There is another animation-mapping macro available, for those wanting
"false-perspective" animations. The macro is named
MAP-PERSPECTIVE-ANIMATION and takes 8 lists of animation
specifications (similar to MAP-ANIMATION).

<h3>Exported symbols</h3>
<dl>

  <dd> Base pathname for assorted graphics and map loading.
 <dt>*font-preference*
  <dd> List of fonts, in order from "most preferred" to "least
preferred" for in-game text.
 <dt>*game-over*
  <dd> Boolean for determining if a game is over or not. May be used
freely by any end-user.
 <dt>*game-window*
  <dd> The X11 window in which all graphics will end up being displayed.
