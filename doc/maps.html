  <h2>The maps library</h2>
 </div>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The deals with "maps" or "levels" and mapping from map descriptions to
graphical tiles to display. In and of itself, the maps do not generate
any graphics, they only specify what sort of tile is where.</p>

This documentation will mention "tile type". A tile type is a keyword,
naming a specific type of tile (door, wall, floor, anything else that
is specified in a map file).

<h3>Defining tile types</h3>
<p>There are two different ways of defining a tile, depending on if the
tile has "in-game self-action" or not. A tile that acts within the
game (other than as an obstacle) is called a generator.</p>

<p>One tile-mapping is pre-defined. The character "S" signifies both a
tile of type :floor and a starting-position for the map. This is at
the moment pre-coded and not likely to change.</p>

<p>A normal tile only needs a character that defines it and a tile
type. They are declared using the define-tile macro:<br>
(define-tile <i>character</i> <i>tile-type</i>)</p>

<p>A generator is like a normal tile, but it also has a generator class
associated with it (one of the classes exported from the GAMES-2D
package) that takes care of its in-game action. Generators are
declared using the define-generator macro:<br>
(define-generator <i>character</i> <i>tile-type</i> <i>generator-type</i>)</p>

<h3>Map definitions</h3>
<p>Maps are defined in text files, with a fairly simple format. The first
line has the map level number, the width and the height of the map, as
numbers. Then, the map follows, using characters mapped to tile types
(designated by CL keywords) in the code. The type keywords are used in
the graphics library to map to bitmaps.</p>

<p>An example from Gatlopp (the first level) looks like:
<pre>
1 10 8
##########
#    S   #
#  $     #
#   $$ # #
#  #  ## #
# ###    #
# >#     #
##########
</pre></p>

<h3>Connecting tiles</h3>
<p>If tiles (like, say, door and wall tiles) don't naturally extend all
the way to the edges of the tile, the maps library has built-in
functionality to help that happen.</p>

<p>The functionality is exposed via the define-type-from-map macro:<br>
(define-type-from-map <i>tile-type</i> <i><b>&rest</b></i>
<i>character</i>)</p>

<p>Doing this means that when tile-from-map finds a <i>tile-type</i>
tile, it will know to look in all four cardinal directions and see if
any of the specified characters are there. If so, it will return a
"derived" tile type (essentially another keyword like
:<i>base</i>-ensw). The keywords for the connecting types will have
one or more of the letters "ensw" (in that order), signifying in what
directions the tile joins up to other tiles.</p>

<p>If the tile doesn't join up, the base type is returned.</p>

<p>As an example, in Gatlopp, the wall tile doesn't extend to the edge
and without using the multi-tile approach, a section of wall from the
map file above might've looked like:<br>
<img src="wall-single.png"><img src="wall-single.png"></p>

<p>If we had declared a multi-tiled type:
<pre>
(define-tile-from-map wall #\# #\+) ; we want to join to walls and doors
</pre>
it would have looked like:<br>
<img src="wall-e.png"><img src="wall-w.png"></p>

<h3>Exported symbols</h3>
<dl>
<dt>*current-map*
 <dd>Bound to a representation of the currently active map
<dt>*mapcount*
 <dd>Number of maps loaded
<dt>activate-map
 <dd>(activate-map <i>seq#</i>)<br>
 Activate a new map. Will set *current-map* and go through the new
map, checking for generators. Checks that seq# is positive and less
than *mapcount*.
<dt>define-generator
 <dd>(define-generator <i>character</i> <i>tile-type</i>
<i>generator-type</i>)<br>
Define a tile type for a generator and associates it with a
game-object class.
<dt>define-tile
<dt>define-type-from-map
<dt>find-starting-position
 <dd>(find-starting-position <i>map</i>)<br>
Find the starting position of the map (if any). Return (<i>x</i>
<i>y</i>) or NIL, depending on.
<dt>height
 <dd>Accessor for map class. Returns the height (in tiles) of a
specific map.
<dt>mapdata
 <dd>Accessor for map class. Returns the array (WxH) of characters
taht is the underlying map storage.
<dt>read-all-maps
 <dd>(read-all-maps <b><i>&optional</i></b> <i>spec</i>)<br>
Read all map. Will default using a wildcarded pathname merged from
*file-path* (defined in the games-2d package) and "*.map". If
<i>spec</i> is provided, this will be used instead.
<dt>seq
 <dd>Accessor for map class. Returns the map sequence number.
<dt>tile-from-map
 <dd>(tile-from-map <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i><b>&optional</b></i>
<i>actual-type</i>)<br>
Return tile-type for tile x,y (if that tile is a generator, return the
generator-type, unless <i>actual-type</i> is non-NIL).
<dt>width
 <dd>Accessor for map class. Return the width of the map.
